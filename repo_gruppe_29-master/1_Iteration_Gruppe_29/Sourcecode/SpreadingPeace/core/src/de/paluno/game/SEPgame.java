//This is the class that should be instantiated in the gameÂ´s main-method and passed to an LwjglApplication instance to start the game.
//It extends Game to enable support for multiple screens. The only method that this class needs to overwrite is the create method.
//Because this method should only ever be called once the game starts, it should set the screen to a new instance of the first screen that needs to be displayed.
